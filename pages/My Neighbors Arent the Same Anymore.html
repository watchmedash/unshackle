    This isn’t a fictional horror story. It’s something that happened to me when I was just 11 years old — and to this day, I still don’t understand it.<br><br>

    I grew up in a small town with my mom, dad, and little brother. Across the street lived my best friend Tyler, with his mom, dad, and older sister Amber.<br><br>

    Tyler’s house was... chaotic. His father was a loud, bitter alcoholic. His mother was constantly stressed, always snapping. And Amber — the stereotypical angry teenager — would lock herself in her room, blasting music and avoiding everyone. That was their normal. Loud. Messy. Dysfunctional.<br><br>

    Until the night everything changed.<br><br>

    I woke up late that night needing to use the bathroom. As I walked past the window, I noticed the lights in Tyler’s house were still on — unusual at that hour. When I returned from the bathroom, I saw Mrs. Mason standing in their backyard, calling for the cat again.<br><br>

    The street was quiet. The wind was cold. I could hear the leaves rustle. She wore one of those old sitcom-style bathrobes and stood still in the night. Then, a loud metallic crash echoed from behind the house.<br><br>

    She hesitated... and walked toward the sound.<br><br>

    Even from across the street, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. Something told me she shouldn’t go. That something was back there, waiting.<br><br>

    Then she screamed. It was sharp. Terrified. Real.<br><br>

    Moments later, Mr. Mason burst through the front door and ran to the backyard. And then — he screamed too. Painful, guttural, broken screams. Then… silence.<br><br>

    No other lights turned on. No neighbors came out. The whole street remained asleep. Except me.<br><br>

    And then… the lights inside the house began turning off. One by one. Tyler’s room. The parents’ room. The living room. The kitchen.<br><br>

    Just when I thought it was over — the living room light flicked back on. Standing in the window was Mrs. Mason. Still. Watching me. I couldn’t see her face, but I knew it was her.<br><br>

    I ran to bed, pulled the blanket over my head, and stayed frozen there. But even under the covers, I felt her eyes on me. From across the street. All night long.<br><br>

    The next morning? Everything was fine.<br><br>

    Too fine.<br><br>

    Mrs. Mason was outside watering the garden — a garden that had been dead for months. Mr. Mason was mowing the lawn, smiling. And Amber was outside in a floral dress, brushing her hair on the porch.<br><br>

    I told my parents. My mom brushed it off. But my dad... he paused. Said the Masons were “too nice” that morning. No arguments. No loud music. No beer cans.<br><br>

    They laughed about it. I didn’t.<br><br>

    Later, Tyler came to play. As he walked toward me, both Mrs. Mason and Amber stood in front of their house, smiling. Wide. Empty. Smiles.<br><br>

    At the park, Tyler was mostly normal. But something was off. He kept glancing over his shoulder. I tried to bring up what happened. The noise. The screams. The silence. He told me it was probably just a dream.<br><br>

    That made my stomach turn. Tyler wasn’t lying. He really didn’t remember. Or… maybe he wasn’t allowed to.<br><br>

    That night, I woke up again. Something pulled me to the window. This time, it was Mr. Mason. Staring from his front lawn. Still. Silent.<br><br>

    I ran to bed, covered myself again — but this time, I heard something behind me. The wooden floor creaking. My heart was pounding. And then… something touched my hair.<br><br>

    I thought I was going to die. I turned around, fully expecting a monster.<br><br>

    It was a spider.<br><br>

    I laughed. I cried. I didn’t care. I’d never been so happy to find a spider on my head.<br><br>

    But the terror? It never really left. Because I know what I saw. I know what I felt. And deep down, I know this:<br><br>

    That family across the street —<br>
    They’re not the same anymore.
