        <h1>Anything, Sir: A Tale of Two Job Markets in the UAE</h1>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MHQzkSqH/image1-large.jpg" alt="Anything, Sir: A Tale of Two Job Markets in the UAE">

        <p>In the shimmering skyline of the UAE, beneath towers of glass and steel, a curious pattern plays out in HR offices and interview rooms across the Emirates.</p>

        <p>I’ve been hiring for years. From Dubai to Abu Dhabi, I’ve met candidates from all corners of the world. But there’s one thing that never fails to surprise me: the difference in how candidates from the West and those from Asia or Africa respond when asked a simple question—</p>

        <blockquote>“What are your salary expectations?”</blockquote>

        <p>Western candidates rarely flinch. With confidence, they state their current or previous salary, followed by a figure they believe they deserve — usually a notch or two higher. There’s no hesitation. It’s business. It’s negotiation.</p>

        <p>But when I pose the same question to others — especially candidates from the Indian subcontinent, the Philippines, or certain African nations — the tone shifts entirely.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “Anything, Sir.”<br>
          “Whatever the company standard is.”<br>
          “I just need a job to utilize my skills, Sir.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>These aren’t just words. These are windows into lives shaped by different economies, different systems, and different levels of bargaining power.</p>

        <p>It’s not that one group is more ambitious than the other — it’s that one is more <strong>empowered</strong> to ask.</p>

        <p>The Western candidate has likely had a history of structured labor laws, transparent pay scales, and perhaps even a culture that encourages negotiation. The others? Often, they carry years of experience in systems where jobs are scarce, visas are golden tickets, and “company standards” — no matter how vague — are better than the uncertainty of unemployment.</p>

        <p>What strikes me most isn't the answers themselves, but the resignation and humility in some voices. A quiet plea wrapped in politeness. A hope that their skills will matter more than their background. A belief that someone — anyone — will see their worth without them needing to name a price.</p>

        <p>It’s not wrong. It’s not right. It’s reality.</p>

        <p>And it makes me ask: in a land built by dreamers and doers, how do we ensure every voice, confident or cautious, gets heard fairly?</p>
