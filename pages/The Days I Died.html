        This isn't your usual horror story. It’s not fiction. It’s not fantasy. It’s real. And I lived it.<br><br>

        I hope, if you’re reading this, you’ll find more than just sadness here — I hope you find proof that survival is possible.<br><br>

        <strong>Eleven.</strong><br>
        I'm in a Walmart bathroom, unconscious. My sister’s number is written on my forearm — so someone knows who to call to claim my body. My heart keeps stopping from the overdose, and people are yelling and pushing and trying to keep me here. I don’t want to be here. I’m nineteen. And I’m homeless.<br><br>

        <strong>Ten.</strong><br>
        I walk quickly toward the bridge, sirens wailing behind me. As I step up to jump, a hand grabs my leg and slams me into the concrete. I black out. I wake up in the psych ward again. I’m eighteen. Still homeless.<br><br>

        <strong>Nine.</strong><br>
        Blood pours from my wrists. It’s pretty. It’s warm. I stare as it trickles from my hands like paint. I’m fifteen. Hiding from my mother. Trying to disappear.<br><br>

        <strong>Eight.</strong><br>
        A bathroom robe tie tightens around my throat. I swing in the air, hoping this will be it. But it snaps, and I hit the floor, my ankle cracking as I land. I’m thirteen. And I’m alone.<br><br>

        <strong>Seven.</strong><br>
        I swallowed too much Tylenol. It hurts. I don’t want to die anymore. I just wanted the pain to stop. I'm twelve, and my mom is nowhere. No one is helping.<br><br>

        <strong>Six.</strong><br>
        I raided my mother’s pill cabinet. Took everything I could. I thought I was dead already. I hallucinate. I scream. She locks me in my room to "sleep it off." I’m eleven.<br><br>

        <strong>Five.</strong><br>
        A friend at school said cutting helped. I tried it. It didn't help. It hurt. A lot. I’m bleeding. I feel dizzy. I just wanted some relief. I’m ten.<br><br>

        <strong>Four.</strong><br>
        I climbed onto the roof and jumped. I wanted it to end. I wanted the men to stop. I wanted my sister to love me. I wanted my mom to say "I love you." She doesn't anymore. I’m eight.<br><br>

        <strong>Three.</strong><br>
        I held my breath underwater in my aunt’s pool, hidden beneath the ladder. The world grew silent and black. My sister pulled me out, scolding me for being stupid. I wish she hadn’t. I’m seven.<br><br>

        <strong>Two.</strong><br>
        I stopped eating. Mommy said I was a burden. I thought maybe if I disappeared slowly, she’d be happy. I’m six.<br><br>

        <strong>One.</strong><br>
        The first time I wanted to die, I was five. The night I was raped for the first time. I stood in the street and begged the universe to run me over. A car stopped. I cried that it should’ve kept going. I just wanted the pain to end.<br><br>

        <hr style="margin: 2em 0;">

        <strong>Please, never assume someone’s story is simple.</strong><br><br>

        Some of us carry darkness that even horror writers couldn’t imagine. But I survived. I now live with eleven tally marks tattooed over my scars — a reminder to never add another. A symbol of my choice to keep going.<br><br>

        I built a life. I built a family. I raise my child with love I never knew. And I show up, every day, for the person I used to be.<br><br>

        To anyone who feels broken: <strong>You are not alone. You are not too far gone. And this world still needs you in it.</strong><br><br>

        Keep moving forward.<br><br>
