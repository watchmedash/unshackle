<h1>Fire, Theft, and Silence: A Harsh Lesson in Al Rigga</h1>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hf4yTrq/image0-large.jpg" alt="Fire, Theft, and Silence: A Harsh Lesson in Al Rigga">

<p>A friend of mine — a hardworking Filipino living in Al Rigga — just went through something that shook me.</p>

<p>He's living in a partitioned building, like many others trying to survive in Dubai while sending money back home. Yesterday, there was a fire in his building. Chaos. Everyone evacuated. He only had time to grab his phone. In the rush, he left his partition door open.</p>

<p>Hours later, when the situation was under control, he came back and went straight to sleep — exhausted, probably just thankful to still have a roof over his head.</p>

<p>But when he woke up, his wallet and his company phone — an iPhone — were gone.</p>

<p>He tried calling the company phone. Someone picked up and immediately hung up. He sent a message to it from his personal number. Finally, a reply came in:</p>

<blockquote>"You want your phone and wallet? Pay me 500."</blockquote>

<p>He went straight to the police and reported what happened. But instead of help, he got hit with another reality check:</p>

<blockquote>"Partition housing is not legal. You have two choices — give him the 500 and move on, or bring him in and settle it yourselves. The police won’t get involved."</blockquote>

<p>To protect the company phone, and avoid drama that could cost him his job or visa, my friend chose the first option. They agreed to meet. The guy came — with backup. He returned the phone and the wallet, which still had 300 dirhams inside. My friend gave him 500 more, making the thief’s total profit 800 dirhams.</p>

<p>He said the guy was probably Jordanian, young, didn’t speak English, and typed only in Arabic. He couldn’t be sure.</p>

<p>But what he was sure of was this: in situations like this, <strong>you’re on your own</strong>. You can’t always count on the system. You have to stand your ground. Know your rights. And sadly, sometimes, swallow the loss for the sake of peace.</p>

<p>This story isn’t just about theft. It’s about power imbalance. About how easily the system can look away when it’s inconvenient. About how silence, fear, and vulnerability shape the daily lives of migrant workers.</p>

<p>Let this be a reminder — <strong>we need to do better</strong>. For ourselves. For each other. And for the ones who don’t have the power to speak up.</p>
