Hi everyone,<br><br>

After spending more than 15 years working in the UAE, and 7 more as a family-sponsored student and resident, I thought I had seen it all. But losing my job and navigating the ILOE (Involuntary Loss of Employment) claim process was a different kind of challenge — one that left me searching for real stories and coming up short.<br><br>

So here’s mine.<br><br>

<strong>February 2, 2025 —</strong> I submitted my ILOE claim through the official app. My company had just terminated my contract due to a major restructuring and eventual closure of operations. The HR team was thorough during our exit process — we were briefed on visa cancellation, banking obligations, final dues, and yes, even our ILOE eligibility.<br><br>

The ILOE app seemed simple enough. It asked for the basics: sector type, Emirates ID, mobile number (linked to ID), and date of birth. After receiving the OTP, I navigated to the claim submission section and uploaded what I believed were the right documents.<br><br>

But then came the first bump in the road.<br><br>

<strong>February 3 —</strong> I got an email saying “Some documents are missing.” Turns out, the app had glitched and submitted duplicates. I took a deep breath, renamed and reorganized everything properly, and uploaded the files again — but this time I waited, double-checked, and only then hit submit.<br><br>

I also emailed <strong>claims@iloe.ae</strong> with a polite message and a clear breakdown of all the documents I had re-submitted. The response was surprisingly fast.<br><br>

<strong>February 4 —</strong> “We’re reviewing your claim.” Simple and reassuring.<br><br>

But just five days later, a new hurdle appeared.<br><br>

<strong>February 9 —</strong> They asked me to provide an “Internal Investigation Report” from my employer to verify that I wasn’t terminated for disciplinary reasons. That stung — because my termination letter already said it clearly: “Due to business closure.” Plus, HR had cleared me completely.<br><br>

I paused. I didn’t send anything. I didn’t even reply.<br><br>

Call it instinct or burnout from endless paperwork, but I figured they had enough. And maybe, just maybe, they would look closely at what I’d already submitted.<br><br>

<strong>February 18 —</strong> I opened my inbox and saw: “Your claim has been approved.”<br><br>

Relief. Shock. Gratitude.<br><br>

Sometimes, I realized, silence is strategy. If your documents already prove your case, don't panic when they ask for more. Stay calm and respectful, and let the system work — when it does.<br><br>

<strong>Claim Payments & Next Steps:</strong><br><br>

The first claim payment arrived within the same week. The second followed 10 days later. Everything was smooth — no reminders, no follow-ups.<br><br>

Then came the bigger decision: exit the UAE or change my visa status. I chose to stay. I worked with a licensed agency (only those approved via official UAE portals) to initiate a status change — no border runs or risky shortcuts.<br><br>

<strong>Here’s what I submitted:</strong><br>
- Visa Cancellation Letter<br>
- ILOE Insurance Certificate<br>
- Emirates ID + Visa Copy<br>
- Last 2–3 Months of Payslips & Bank Statements<br>
- End of Service (EOS) Document<br>
- Employment Contract (MOHRE-registered)<br>
- Termination Letter + Tenure Letter<br>
- Updated Bank Details (via ILOE portal)<br><br>

<strong>My honest takeaways:</strong><br><br>

- Triple-check your uploads. The ILOE app isn’t perfect — you need to be.
- Don’t overreact to follow-up requests. If your documents already cover what they’re asking, sometimes it’s okay to let it sit.
- Always be polite and clear in emails. They do reply — and sometimes, that tone makes all the difference.
- Keep digital copies of everything before you lose access to work emails and portals.
- For visa transfers or status changes, go through official, government-listed agencies only.<br><br>

I’m not a lawyer, not a PRO — just someone who’s lived in the UAE long enough to know that every situation is different. What worked for me might not be universal. But if you’re going through something similar, I hope this gives you clarity, hope, and strength.<br><br>

Please don’t message me for personal help — I’m not an expert. But do comment if this helped or you’ve got advice for others.<br><br>

We’ve all faced hard resets before. We’ll face them again. And we’ll come out stronger.<br><br>

Stay strong, fellow expats.
